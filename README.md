how it works
____________

in caesar cipher each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions (shift) down the alphabet. Assuming that shift is 3 when encrypting, A would be replaced by D, B would be replaced by E, and so on. when decrypting the encrypted message D would simply replaced by A, E would be replaced by B, and so on.
